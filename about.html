									<h1>About</h1>
									<p><h3>Mads E. Kampman</h3><br />
                                        Here you can read and learn about me, including my values, ambitions, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="main image"><img src="images/Mads.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I was born in Denmark in 1996 and have lived there most of my life, before moving to Valencia, Spain in 2022. I am a very passionate and goal-orientated person, that values and practices time efficiency and management, striving for creating and delivering high quality results, and the importance of family. I am also a person with high attention to detail, with the mentality of a hard and devoted worker, and with the willingness to learn, and learn fast. I am very perfectionistic with skill learning and with my work, which can sometimes create a stubbornness to make it 100% perfect before moving to the next task. During my time in Denmark, I have studied most of my life and worked since the age of 19 both part-time and full-time. I have always enjoyed keeping myself busy and motivated towards reaching goals. Both in studies and in work I have gained a countless amount of experience in Teamwork, presentation skills, as well as tools such as MS Office, MS Visual Studios, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Scrum, Trello etc.</p>
								<p>I moved to Valencia for family specific reasons, and that is exactly what I want to find in my next company - family.</p>
